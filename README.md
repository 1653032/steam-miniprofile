### A little hack to get your Steam's miniprofile
This is a tool that loads your miniprofile as a HTML entity so that you can feature it on your website.

### Guide

1. Get your Steam's **AccountID**, you can use [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/calculator/) or google how to find it yourself.
2. Access `https://1653032.github.io/steam-miniprofile/?accountId={_accountId_}`

Note:
1. Your profile will need to be public for this to work.
2. It will track your _public_ status (Online, Offline), but It *wont* track your _friend-only_ status (Away,...).  
2. If your AccountID is invalid, it will instead load *MY*(as in the one writing this) miniprofile :).
